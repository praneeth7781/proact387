# Proactive Mental Health Monitoring System

## Overview
In recent years, the suicide rates are very high among students. The external environment the student experiences can cause mental issues such as Trauma, Depression. There are many factors that might push students into clinical depression, the following being few of them: Adjustment issues (Far from home, climate difference, language barrier in study medium), No support system - in event of sickness or injury, Academic pressure (high expectations and excellence standards), Financial, Ragging and other harassment

Few of the symptoms of clinical depression are low enthusiasm, fatigue, lack of sound sleep, concentration, frustration, irritability, suicidal tendency. These symptoms can be recognised earlier and can be addressed which might help the individual. So we propose our solution, which is a "Proactive Health Monitoring Website". It is a monitoring system that tracks an individual's academic and non-academic activities, and takes feedback from various people in their social sphere, such as friends, batchmates, neighbors, and mentors. Based on the feedback provided, the system calculates an engagement level, which serves as an indicator of the individual's level of involvement and motivation.

If the engagement level drops below a certain threshold, the system sends a notification to the appropriate authorities, such as parents or guardians, to alert them of the situation. This system could potentially be useful in helping individuals stay on track and ensuring they receive necessary support and intervention if they are struggling or disengaged.

However, it is important to consider the potential privacy concerns that may arise from such a system, particularly if sensitive information about an individual's academic or personal life is shared with multiple parties. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the feedback provided is accurate and unbiased, and that the system does not create undue pressure or stress on the individual being monitored. Overall, careful consideration and implementation of such a monitoring system would be necessary to ensure its effectiveness and ethical use.
